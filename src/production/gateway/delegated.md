title: Configure a delegated gateway
---
## Delegated

The `Dataplane` entity can operate in `gateway` mode. This way you can integrate Kuma with existing API Gateways like [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong).

The `gateway` mode lets you skip exposing inbound listeners so it won't be intercepting ingress traffic. When you use a data plane proxy with a service, both inbound traffic to a service and outbound traffic from the service flows through the proxy. In the `gateway` mode, you want inbound traffic to go directly to the gateway, otherwise, clients require dynamically generated certificates for communication between services within the mesh. The gateway itself should handle security at an entrance to the mesh.

### Usage

{% tabs usage useUrlFragment=false %}
{% tab usage Kubernetes %}

Kuma supports most of the ingress controllers. However, the recommended gateway in Kubernetes is [Kong](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway). You can use [Kong ingress controller for Kubernetes](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/) to implement authentication, transformations, and other functionalities across Kubernetes clusters with zero downtime.
Most ingress controllers require an annotation [`ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream=true`](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/2.1.x/references/annotations/#ingresskubernetesioservice-upstream) on every Kubernetes `Service` to work with Kuma. Kuma automatically injects the annotation for every `Service` in a namespace in a mesh that has `kuma.io/sidecar-injection: enabled` label.

To use the delegated gateway feature, mark your API Gateway's Pod with the `kuma.io/gateway: enabled` annotation. Control plane automatically generates `Dataplane` objects.

For example:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kuma.io/gateway: enabled
      ...
```

API Gateway receives Services from:
* one specific zone
* multi-zone

Multi-zone requires exposing a dedicated Kubernetes `Service` object with type `ExternalName`. Control plane creates a DNS entry `externalName` with suffix `.mesh`, which Kuma resolves in internal [service discovery](/docs/{{ page.version }}/networking/dns).

#### Example setting up Kong Ingress Controller

Follow instructions to setup an echo service reachable through Kong.
These instructions are mostly taken from the [Kong docs](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/2.1.x/guides/getting-started/).

1. [Install Kuma](/docs/{{ page.version }}/installation/kubernetes) on your cluster and have the `default` [namespace labelled with sidecar-injection](/docs/{{ page.version }}/explore/dpp-on-kubernetes).

2. Install [Kong using helm](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/2.1.x/deployment/k4k8s/#helm).

3. Start an echo-service:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://bit.ly/echo-service
```

4. Add an ingress:

```shell
echo "
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: demo
spec:
  ingressClassName: kong
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /foo
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
        backend:
          service:
            name: echo
            port:
              number: 80
" | kubectl apply -f -
```

You can access your ingress with `curl -i $PROXY_IP/foo` where `$PROXY_IP` you can retrieve from the service that exposes Kong outside your cluster.

You can check that the sidecar is running by checking the number of containers in each pod:

```shell
kubectl get pods
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
echo-5fc5b5bc84-zr9kl                   2/2     Running   0          41m
kong-1645186528-kong-648b9596c7-f2xfv   3/3     Running   2          40m
```

#### Example Gateway in Multi-Zone

In the previous example, you setup an `echo`, that's running on port `80`, and deployed in the `default` namespace.

Now make sure that this service works correctly with multi-zone. In order to do so, create `Service` manually:

```shell
echo "
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: echo-multizone
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: echo.default.svc.80.mesh
" | kubectl apply -f -
```

Finally, you need to create a corresponding Kubernetes `Ingress` that routes `/bar` to the multi-zone service:

```shell
echo "
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: demo-multizone
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: kong
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /bar
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            backend:
              service:
                name: echo-multizone
                port:
                  number: 80
" | kubectl apply -f -
```

Note that since you are addressing the service by its domain name `echo.default.svc.8080.mesh`, you should always refer to port `80`. This port is only a placeholder and is automatically replaced with the actual port of the service.

If you want to expose a `Service` in one zone only, as opposed to multi-zone, you can just use the service name in the `Ingress` definition without having to create an `externalName` entry, this is what you did in your first example.

{% tab usage Universal %}

On Universal, you can define the `Dataplane` entity like this:

```yaml
type: Dataplane
mesh: default
name: kong-01
networking:
  address: 10.0.0.1
  gateway:
    type: DELEGATED
    tags:
      kuma.io/service: kong
  outbound:
    - port: 33033
      tags:
        kuma.io/service: backend
```

When configuring your API Gateway to pass traffic to _backend_ set the url to `http://localhost:33033`
