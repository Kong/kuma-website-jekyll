# Secure access across Kuma components 

This page explains how secure access is provided across a Kuma deployment:

- [security between the data plane proxies and the Kuma control plane](#data-plane-proxy-to-control-plane-communication)
- [security between the user and the Kuma control plane](#user-to-control-plane-communication)
- [security between the Kuma control planes (Multizone)](#control-plane-to-control-plane-multizone)

Kuma stores autogenerated certificates and other files in a working directory. The default value for this
directory is `$HOME/.kuma`. You can change the working directory by setting the `KUMA_GENERAL_WORK_DIR` environment variable.

:::tip
This section is not to be confused with the [mTLS policy](../policies/mutual-tls/) that we can apply to a [Mesh](../policies/mesh/) to secure service-to-service traffic.

## Data plane proxy to control plane communication

A data plane proxy connects to the control plane for its configuration, including mTLS certificates described in the following sections.

### Encrypted communication

Because the data plane proxy and the control plane exchange sensitive information, the communication needs to be encrypted by TLS.
By default, the control plane's server that is consumed by the data plane proxy is secured by TLS with autogenerated certificates.

It is recommended that the data plane proxy verifies the identity of the control plane. To do so, data plane proxies need to obtain the CA that was used to generate the certificate by which the control plane's server is secured.
Note, this CA is not the same CA for service-to-service communication.

**To override autogenerated certificates**

::: tip
If overridden, Kuma uses the certificates to protect not only [data plane proxy to control plane](#data-plane-proxy-to-control-plane-communication) traffic
but also [user to control plane](#user-to-control-plane-communication) traffic
and [control plane to control plane](#control-plane-to-control-plane-multizone) traffic.
:::

1) Prepare certificates

Generate a TLS pair with a PKI of your choice and store it in PEM-encoded format in `/tmp/tls.crt`, `/tmp/tls.key`. 
Store the CA that was used to sign this pair in `/tmp/ca.crt`.

We can also use `kumactl` to generate self-signed certs:
```sh
kumactl generate tls-certificate \
  --type=server \
  --hostname=<KUMA_CP_DNS_NAME> \
  --cert-file=/tmp/tls.crt \
  --key-file=/tmp/tls.key
```

Since "tls.crt" is a self-signed cert, it is also a CA:
```sh
cp /tmp/tls.crt /tmp/ca.crt
```

2) Configure the control plane with generated certs:

:::: tabs :options="{ useUrlFragment: false }"
::: tab "Kubernetes (kumactl)"
Create a secret in the namespace where the control plane is installed:
```sh
kubectl create secret generic general-tls-certs -n <namespace> \
  --from-file=tls.crt=/tmp/tls.crt \
  --from-file=tls.key=/tmp/tls.key \
  --from-file=ca.crt=/tmp/ca.crt
```

Point to this secret when installing Kuma:
```sh
kumactl install control-plane \
  --tls-general-secret=general-tls-certs \
  --tls-general-ca-bundle=$(cat /tmp/ca.crt | base64)
```

The data plane proxy Injector in the control plane automatically provides the CA to the Kuma DP sidecar 
so Kuma DP can confirm the control plane identity.

:::
::: tab "Kubernetes (HELM)"
Create a secret in the namespace where the control plane is installed:
```sh
kubectl create secret generic general-tls-certs -n <namespace> \
  --from-file=tls.crt=/tmp/tls.crt \
  --from-file=tls.key=/tmp/tls.key \
  --from-file=ca.crt=/tmp/ca.crt
```

Point to this secret when installing Kuma:
```sh
helm install --create-namespace --namespace <namespace> kuma kuma/kuma \
  --set controlPlane.tls.general.secretName=general-tls-certs \
  --set controlPlane.tls.general.caBundle=$(cat /tmp/ca.crt | base64)
```

The data plane proxy Injector in the control plane automatically provides the CA to the Kuma DP sidecar 
so Kuma DP can confirm the control plane identity.

:::
::: tab "Universal"
Configure the control plane with generated certificates:

```sh
KUMA_GENERAL_TLS_CERT_FILE=/tmp/tls.crt \
  KUMA_GENERAL_TLS_KEY_FILE=/tmp/tls.key \
  kuma-cp run
```

Configure the data plane proxy with CA:

```sh
kuma-dp run \
  --cp-address=https://<KUMA_CP_DNS_NAME>:5678 \
  --ca-cert-file=/tmp/ca.crt \
  --dataplane-file=dp.yaml \
  --dataplane-token-file=/tmp/kuma-dp-redis-1-token
```

You can also provide the CA via environment variable `KUMA_CONTROL_PLANE_CA_CERT`.

### Authentication

See [Data plane proxy authentication](./dp-auth.md) and [Zone Ingress authentication](./zone-ingress-auth.md).

## User to control plane communication

Users and automation tools can interact with the control plane via the API Server using tools like `curl` or `kumactl`.
API Server is exposed by default on `:5681` on HTTP and `:5682` on HTTPS.

### Encrypted communication

The API Server HTTPS server is secured by default by autogenerated certificates.

**To override autogenerated certificates.**

1) Prepare certificates

Generate TLS pair with a PKI of your choice and store it in PEM-encoded format in `/tmp/tls.crt`, `/tmp/tls.key`. Store the CA that was used to sign this pair in `/tmp/ca.crt`

We can also use `kumactl` to generate self-signed certs:
```sh
kumactl generate tls-certificate \
  --type=server \
  --hostname=<KUMA_CP_DNS_NAME> \
  --cert-file=/tmp/tls.crt \
  --key-file=/tmp/tls.key
```

Since "tls.crt" is a self-signed cert, it is also a CA:
```sh
cp /tmp/tls.crt /tmp/ca.crt
```

2) Configure the control plane with generated certificates
:::: tabs :options="{ useUrlFragment: false }"
::: tab "Kubernetes (kumactl)"
Create a secret in the namespace in which the control plane is installed:
```sh
kubectl create secret tls api-server-tls -n <namespace> \
  --cert=/tmp/tls.crt \
  --key=/tmp/tls.key
```

Point to this secret when installing Kuma:
```sh
kumactl install control-plane \
  --tls-api-server-secret=api-server-tls
```
:::
::: tab "Kubernetes (HELM)"
Create a secret in the namespace in which the control plane is installed:
```sh
kubectl create secret tls api-server-tls -n <namespace> \
  --cert=/tmp/tls.crt \
  --key=/tmp/tls.key
```

Point to this secret when installing Kuma:
```sh
helm install --create-namespace --namespace <namespace> kuma kuma/kuma \
  --set controlPlane.tls.apiServer.secretName=api-server-tls
```

:::
::: tab "Universal"
Point to the certificate and the key:
```sh
KUMA_API_SERVER_HTTPS_TLS_CERT_FILE=/tmp/tls.crt \
  KUMA_API_SERVER_HTTPS_TLS_KEY_FILE=/tmp/tls.key \
  kuma-cp run
```

::: 
::::

3) Configure secure connection using `kumactl` CLI tool:
```sh
kumactl config control-planes add \
  --name=<NAME> \
  --address=https://<KUMA_CP_DNS_NAME>:5682 \
  --ca-cert-file=/tmp/ca.crt \
```

We can also hide the HTTP version of API Server by binding it to localhost `KUMA_API_SERVER_HTTP_INTERFACE: 127.0.0.1` or by disabling it altogether `KUMA_API_SERVER_HTTP_ENABLED: false`

### Authentication

See [API Server authentication](./api-server-auth.md).

## Control plane to control plane (Multizone)

A zone control plane connects to a global control plane for policies configuration.

### Encrypted communication

Because the global control plane and the zone control plane exchange sensitive information, the communication needs to be encrypted by TLS.
By default, the global control plane's server that is consumed by the zone control plane is secured by TLS with autogenerated certificates.

It is recommended that the zone control plane verifies the identity of the global control plane. To do so, zone control planes need to obtain the CA that was used to generate the certificate by which the control plane's server is secured.

**To override autogenerated certificates**

1) Prepare certificates 

Generate TLS pair with a PKI of your choice and store it in PEM-encoded format in `/tmp/tls.crt`, `/tmp/tls.key`. 
Store the CA that was used to sign this pair in `/tmp/ca.crt`

We can also use `kumactl` to generate self-signed certs:
```sh
kumactl generate tls-certificate \
  --type=server \
  --hostname=<CROSS_ZONE_KUMA_CP_DNS_NAME> \
  --cert-file=/tmp/tls.crt \
  --key-file=/tmp/tls.key
```

Since "tls.crt" is a self-signed cert, it is also a CA:
```sh
cp /tmp/tls.crt /tmp/ca.crt
```

2) Configure global control plane
:::: tabs :options="{ useUrlFragment: false }"

Create a secret in the namespace where the global control plane is installed:
```sh
kubectl create secret tls kds-server-tls -n <namespace> \
  --cert=/tmp/tls.crt \
  --key=/tmp/tls.key
```

Point to this secret when installing the global control plane:
```sh
kumactl install control-plane \
  --mode=global \
  --tls-kds-global-server-secret=general-tls-certs
```
:::
::: tab "Kubernetes (HELM)"
Create a secret in the namespace where the global control plane is installed:
```sh

```

Point to this secret when installing Kuma:
```sh
helm install --create-namespace --namespace <namespace> kuma kuma/kuma \
  --set controlPlane.tls.kdsGlobalServer.secretName=kds-server-tls
```

3) Configure the zone control plane

:::: tabs :options="{ useUrlFragment: false }"
::: tab "Kubernetes (kumactl)"
Create a secret in the namespace where the zone control plane is installed:
```sh
kubectl create secret generic kds-ca-certs -n <namespace> \
  --from-file=ca.crt.pem=/tmp/ca.crt
```

Point to this secret when installing the zone control plane:
```sh
kumactl install control-plane \

:::
::: tab "Kubernetes (HELM)"
Create a secret in the namespace where the zone control plane is installed:
```sh

  --from-file=ca.crt.pem=/tmp/ca.crt
```

Point to this secret when installing Kuma:
```sh
helm install --create-namespace --namespace <namespace> kuma kuma/kuma \

### Authentication

Define firewall rules on the global control plane to only accept connections from known IPs of the zone control planes.

:::tip
Third-party extensions, cloud implementations or [commercial offerings](/enterprise) may be extending the authentication support.
