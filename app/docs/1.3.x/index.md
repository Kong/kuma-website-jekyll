# Welcome to Kuma

Welcome to the documentation for Kuma, a modern distributed **Control Plane** for service mesh with a bundled Envoy proxy integration.

The word "Kuma" means "bear" in Japanese („ÇØ„Éû).

The core maintainer of Kuma is **Kong**, the maker of the popular open-source Kong Gateway ü¶ç.

There's a new docs page that explains how your Kuma deployment collects data: what data is collected, and how to turn off data collection. See [data collection](/docs/1.3.1/community/data-collection).
